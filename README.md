# odin-recipes
Recipe project on the odin project

This is a project that will test my understanding of what has been covered so
far in The Odin Project. I will hopefully be able to demonstrate the following 
skills:

Knowledge and understanding of the Command Line Interface, creating directories
and files. Moving between working directories. Renaming of documents. Viewing
directory and file details.

Application of the distributed version control system Git. Showing the ability
to add, remove and commit changes through Git which are pushed on to Github.

I will also demonstrate a basic understanding of HTML, namely:
Setting up a basic HTML template from memory
Use of <!-- <meta>, <a href=>, <p>, <em>, <strong>, <img src= width= alt=>, 
<ol> and <ul> tages --> 

The website itself will contain recipes and links to them. It will be basic 
but functional.
