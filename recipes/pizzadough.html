    <p>Make your own easy pizza dough with this authentic Italian recipe – it uses '00' flour to give the 
        base a lighter, crisper texture. </p>
    <p>But if you have bread flour, it will still produce a great homemade pizza.</p>
    <p><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Easy</p>
    <p><Strong>Time: </Strong>10 to 30 minutes</p>
    <div>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>650g/1lb 7oz '00' flour (or strong white flour), plus extra for dusting</li>
        <li>7g dried easy-blend yeast</li>
        <li>2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>25ml/1fl oz olive oil</li>
        <li>50ml/2fl oz warm milk</li>
        <li>325ml/11fl oz warm water</li>

    </ul>
    </div>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To make the dough, mix the flour, yeast and salt together in a <br>
            large bowl and stir in the olive oil and milk. Gradually add the water, <br>
            mixing well to form a soft dough.</li> <p></p>

        <li>Turn the dough out on to a floured surface and knead for about 5 minutes, <br>
            until smooth and elastic. Transfer to a clean bowl, cover with a damp teatowel <br>
            and leave to rise for about 1½ hours, until doubled in size.</li><p></p>

        <li>When the dough has risen, knock it back, then knead again until smooth,<br>
            roll into a ball and set aside for 30 minutes to 1 hour until risen again.</li><p></p>
        <li>Preheat the oven to its highest setting.</li><p></p>
        <li>Divide the dough into six balls and roll each out on a lightly floured work surface <br>
            until 20cm/8in in diameter. (You can also make one big pizza.) Spread a little passata <br>
            (or homemade tomato sauce) over each pizza base and top with your favourite toppings. </li><p></p>
        <li>Bake the pizzas in the oven for 10–12 minutes until the bases are crisp and golden brown <br>
            around the edges and any cheese on top has melted.</li>
