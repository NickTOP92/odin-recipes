        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>4 tsp plain flour</li>
        <li>4 tsp cornflour</li>
        <li>375ml double cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the icing:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>100g plain chocolate</li>
        <li>25g butter</li>
        <li>1 tbsp icing sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Start by making the custard filling. Heat the milk until almost boiling in a saucepan. <br>
            Meanwhile, mix together the sugar, egg yolks and vanilla in a bowl, then stir in the flours,<br>
            a couple of tsp at a time, to a smooth paste.</li> <p></p>
        <li>Gradually whisk in the hot milk, pour everything back into the saucepan and cook over a high heat,<br>
             stirring constantly, for about 5 mins until thick – it will go alarmingly lumpy but don’t worry, just <br>
             keep stirring it vigorously with a wooden spoon until smooth<p></p>
        <li>Lay a sheet of cling film directly on the custard surface, then cool and chill until you’re <br>
            ready to fill the buns.</li><p></p>
        <li>To make the choux buns, heat the oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Sift the flour with the sugar and <br>
            a pinch of salt into a small bowl. Put the milk and butter into a medium saucepan with 125ml water and <br>
            gently heat so the butter melts but the liquid doesn’t bubble.</li><p></p>
        <li>Once the butter has completely melted, increase the heat until the liquid <br>
            comes to a fast rolling boil. Immediately turn off the heat, tip in the sifted <br>
            flour and beat vigorously with a wooden spoon until you a have a smooth dough that <br>
            comes away from the sides of the pan. Spread over a large dinner plate to cool to hand <br>
            temperature.</li><p></p>
        <li>Allow to cool for a few minutes, then gradually add the eggs, mixing well between each <br>
            addition until the mixture reluctantly drops off the spoon. Don’t add all the egg unless you need to.</li><p></p>
        <li>Cut two large sheets of baking parchment. On each one draw two sets of ‘track’ lines with a<br>
            10cm gap – these will be your guidelines so your eclairs will all be roughly the same size. <br>
            Use the paper to line two large baking sheets – penside down.</li><p></p>
        <li>Spoon your choux mixture into a piping bag with a 1cm star or round wide nozzle, or into a <br>
            disposable piping bag with a similar-size hole snipped off for piping. Pipe two rows of well-spaced, <br>
            squashed ‘S’ shapes on each sheet between the guidelines. Bake, one tray at a time, on a high-ish shelf <br>
            for 25 mins, reducing temperature to 200C/180C fan/gas 6 as soon as they go in the oven.</li><p></p>

        <li>While the buns are cooling, finish your filling. Whisk the cream until thick, then use your electric <br>
            whisk to beat the cooled, set custard until just smooth again. Fold in the cream. Spoon your filling into <br>
            a piping bag – use a small nozzle if you’re filling the buns through the holes you've pierced, or a large nozzle <br>
            if you’ve split the buns in half. Carefully pipe the custard into each cooled bun – they should feel heavy once full.</li><p></p>
        <li>To make the icing, melt 100g plain chocolate and 25g butter together in a heatproof bowl over a pan of barely <br>
            simmering water. Once melted, remove from the heat and stir in 75ml double cream and 1 tbsp sifted icing sugar. <br>
            Once cooled a little, spread over the tops of the buns and leave to cool.</li><p></p>
