        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 medium eggs</li>
            <li>Bread for soldiers</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill a medium sized saucepan with water and bring to a rolling boil. <p></p>
            <li>Make sure your eggs aren't fridge cold. By having the eggs at room <br>
                temperature, it will be less of a shock for the egg reaching the hot <br>
                water and therefore less likely to crack. You can also use an egg pricker <br>
                to make a very small hole in each egg before boiling, which will also reduce <br>
                the chances of it cracking in the heat. Slowly lower the eggs into the water <br>
                using a spoon.</li><p></p>
            <li>Set your timer for 4-5 mins for runny/dippy eggs to serve with soldiers, or 6-7 <br>
                mins for soft-boiled eggs for a salad. If serving in a salad, plunge the eggs into <br>
                a bowl of cold water as soon as the timer goes off â€“ this will stop them cooking and <br>
                cool the shells quickly for peeling.</li><p></p>
